                        Hi, Iâ€™m Aaron Moon
                        </h2>

                    <p>
                        I am a third-year student at University of California, San Diego majoring in Mathematics - Computer Science and minoring in Design. I am hoping to pursue a full-time career in Technical Consulting but I am also interested in Software Engineering. <br/><br/>I was born and raised in Orange County, California but I love to travel and visit new places. I love learning new things, whether it be for my professional career or exploring new hobbies, but above all, I enjoy the little things life has to offer. I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, listening to indie music on late night drives, going to the gym and climbing, exploring tasty restaurants, and so much more.
